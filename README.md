# LangParser

I needed a basic command language parser for the templates I was writing, so I decided to roll this little class. I haven't had time to really flesh out the interface yet, so for now it's just a utility class that provides a method for parsing arguments out of parenthesis. Eventually it would be nice to formalize it a bit and turn it into something that you could use to create an environment and execute.
